Fedora Remix for Raspberry Pi
with mainline kernel & U-Boot
=============================

WHAT
----

This is a Linux distribution for Raspberry Pi devices with kernel that
is not as significantly deviant from mainline as is the case for popular
Raspberry Pi distributions, such as Raspbian [1] and Pidora [2].

[1] http://www.raspbian.org/
[2] http://pidora.ca/

It is largely based on Fedora source packages, whereas most binary builds
(apart from kernel and boot loader) come from Pidora.

Packages with stable and development (Rawhide) kernel are available.

WHY
---

While the Raspberry Pi branch of the kernel ships currently provides
significantly better hardware support, it comes at the expense of quality,
security and sanity in general. On the other hand, code merged into
mainline kernel receives significant amount of code and design reviews,
resulting in robust, secure and portable designs. The downside is that it
takes time and effort.

The kernel package provided here is based on Fedora one, and follows the
estabilished practices wherever feasible:

* A lot of general purpose drivers and subsystems are enabled
  (Most devices connectable to USB are supported, SELinux, ...)
* The kernel is multi-platform (though Raspberry Pi is the only
  platform enabled) and Device Tree is used to configure it
* U-Boot with extlinux configuration is used to boot the kernel

Subsystems with questionable or plainly wrong security in Raspberry Pi
kernel (such as raw access to the mbox or VCHIQ) are not present, resulting
in somewhat limited hardware support. Hopefully, the ready-to-use
distribution will make it easier to port and tidy them up.

INSTALLATION
------------

0.) Download the image [3] and uncompress it with unxz(1)
1.) Use dd(1) to copy the image to SD memory card
2.) Boot your Raspberry Pi from the card
3.) Log in as root
4.) Set the root password with passwd(1) command
5.) Resize the root volume to your memory card's size with resize2fs(8):
    "resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2"

HARDWARE SUPPORT
----------------

Serial console, framebuffer, MMC and USB (and thus Ethernet) are known to
work.

NOTES
-----

This is not an official Fedora distribution image. It uses Generic branding
(logos, banners) instead of Fedora. It's merely largely based on Fedora
sources -- most of the binaries come from Pidora.

The package collection is fairly minimal -- it's basically the @Core group.
If you need anything else, add it with yum(8).

SELinux is disabled in present release, until a reason for frequent mmap_zero
denials is discovered and the issue is fixed.

Add console=ttyAMA0,115200 to kernel command line in extlinux/extlinux.conf
on the first (BOOT) partition to enable serial console.

As the device has no non-volatile memory, the Ethernet device MAC address
changes on each boot.

The vanilla image contains a stable kernel image. To install the Rawhide one,
run "yum --enablerepo=fedora-rpi-devel update kernel".

SOURCE
------

Packages and tools used to build the image are available from the Git
repositories [4].
